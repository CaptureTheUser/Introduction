Aim of this challenge is to obtain password for the GitHub account (CaptureTheUser).
Password is embedded in string in github connection inside executable. 
Furthermore, the executable is inside Docker container you have just ran (directory: /app/codete).
As a matter of fact, this text was cloned from repository (CaptureTheUser/Introduction).

Your task is to reverse-engineer forementioned executable.

We have provided some tips to get you started; examine image located in container (directory: /app/codete.jpg)
to get on the right track (or just start hacking on your own!).

First person acquiring password will get (insert prize here).

After CaptureTheUser acquistion remember to IMMEDIATELY change password to your own.
Furthermore create some dummy repository using this account and e-mail us you have done it.

Best of luck,
Codete
